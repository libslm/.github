Welcome to **Libslm** — a chaotic collection of experiments, half-baked ideas, and bursts of inspiration. This isn't a polished, production-ready organization. It's a playground for concepts that may or may not evolve into something meaningful.

Due to its experimental nature, stability is not guaranteed. Features may change, vanish, or break at any time. If you're here for reliability, you might want to look elsewhere. But if you're here out of curiosity, exploration, or sheer madness — welcome aboard.

> ⚠️ Use projects at your own risk. Enjoy the ride.
